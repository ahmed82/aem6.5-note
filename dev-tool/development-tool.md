* Immutable

1. Code persisted in repository (/apps) can be checked into Git and deployed
through Cloud Manager
1. Code should never be deployed directly on dev, stage and prod environment
1. Example: OSGi Configuration should be committed to source control rather than
managed at runtime via Web Console's configuration manager
